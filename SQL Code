As part of short data personal data projecting using SQL and PowerBI, I looked into the music I had listened to in 2019 from the app Spotify. 

Questions:

What songs were played mosts? And what are the most popular artists?

What were the most skipped songs? Skipped songs listened for less than 10



/* What was the most popular songs played*/
SELECT
  master_metadata_track_name AS song_name,
  master_metadata_album_artist_name AS artist,
  ms_played,
  ts,
FROM year_19
ORDER by ms_played


/*What was the most popular albums played (at least 5 songs listened) */
WITH album_plays AS (SELECT
  master_metadata_album_album_name AS album,
  master_metadata_album_artist_name AS artist,
  COUNT (DISTINCT master_metadata_track_name) AS count_times,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM wyk-syed-hussain.spotify.19c
GROUP BY album, artist
ORDER by total DESC)


SELECT *

/Most popular song and artist by month/

/* What does cumulative listening time look like overtime, per week/*



WITH time_listen AS (SELECT
